# Dataflow optimizer

This is a DNN dataflow optimizer to find a optimal or `approximately` optimal
dataflow for a particular DNN with a defined hardware configuration.

## Why

The goal of this optimizer are followings:

* First, this optimizer is to aim to find a close-to optimal configuration in
  order to minimize the latency and reduce the data traffic at the same time.
* Second, this optimizer explores different searching or optimization schemes,
  so that, we can show the trade-off between different optimization schemes.
* Third, this optimizer can automatically decompose deconvolutions in the
  DNN pipeline and apply different level optimizations to deconvolutions.

## What's inside

There are two main parts in this framework:
1. The overall framework to drive different optimizers.

* `dnn_optimizer.py`
* `dataflow_search.py`

2. The layer-level optimizers to optimize different

* `layer_base_method.py`
* `layer_optimizer.py`
* `layer_exhaustive_searcher.py`
* `deconv_exhaustive_searcher.py`

You can run the example dataflow optimization by `runner.sh`.

## How to use

To use the dataflow optimizer, you can run for helping info:

```
  $ python dataflow_search.py -h
```

By specify the configuration in the input option and a particular DNN network
you want to optimize, the optimizer will return a dataflow scheme for you. The
sample DNN networks are in the `/dnns` directory.
