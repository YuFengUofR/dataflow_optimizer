# Dataflow optimizer

This is a DNN dataflow optimizer to find a optimal or `approximately` optimal
dataflow for a particular DNN with a defined hardware configuration.

## Why

The goal of this optimizer are followings:

* First, this optimizer is to aim to find a close-to optimal configuration in
  order to minimize the latency and reduce the data traffic at the same time.
* Second, this optimizer explores different searching or optimization schemes,
  so that, we can show the trade-off between different optimization schemes.
* Third, this optimizer can automatically decompose deconvolutions in the
  DNN pipeline and apply different level optimizations to deconvolutions.

## What's inside

There are two main parts in this framework:
1. The overall framework to drive different optimizers.

* `dnn_optimizer.py`
* `dataflow_search.py`

2. The layer-level optimizers to optimize different

* `layer_base_method.py`
* `layer_optimizer.py`
* `layer_exhaustive_searcher.py`
* `deconv_exhaustive_searcher.py`

You can run the example dataflow optimization by `runner.sh`.

## How to use

To use the dataflow optimizer, you can run for helping info:

```
  $ python dataflow_search.py -h
```

By specify the configuration in the input option and a particular DNN network
you want to optimize, the optimizer will return a dataflow scheme for you. The
sample DNN networks are in the `/dnns` directory.

## Explanation of each option flags

There are three parts consisted all the flags

1. input and output files
  * `--dnnfile` : the actual dnn dataflow file to optimize.
  * `--outfile` : the file to dump all the result.

2. options that are related to search options
  * `--static` :  to set the flag if static partition the buffer enable
  * `--split` : enable to split the convolution kernel into small sub-kernels
  * `--combine` : enable to combine the sub-kernels durting compute
  * `--model_type` : DNN model convolution type: 2D or 3D.
  * `--ifmap` : the ifmap dimemsion, order: [W H C]
  * `--ifmap3d` : the ifmap dimemsion, order: [W H D C]
  * `--buffer_partition` : the ifmap dimemsion, order: [I O W]
  * `--search_method` : there are three search options: "Constrained",
     "Exhaustive", "Combined", the first one is to use constrained optimization,
     "Exhaustive" is a exhaustive search with the combination of DP.
     "Combine" is to use static partition to set initial guess values for 
     constrained optimization and then use constrained optimization.

3. other hardware configurations
  * `--bufsize`, type=float, default=1048576.0*1.5,
  * help="in Btyes")
  * `--memory_bandwidth`, type=float, default=6.4*4,
  * help="in GB/s")
  * `--sa_size`, type=float, default=16,
  * help="Systolic array size")
  * `--bit_width`, type=float, default=16,
  * help="Bit Width of each value (typically, 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit)")
  * 
  *
